#### Calculating The Credit Score

Credit score calculation is based on simple algorithm that takes the age, salary and guranatee index from user and combines with pre-determined coefficients to obtain user credit score.

Method Name: <span style="color:red">CalculateUserCredit</span>
```
credit score = ∑〖1.354 x ageIndex+ 0.85 x salaryIndex+2.1.2 x guaranteeIndex〗
```

once the credit score is calculated, then <span style="color:red">CreateUserCredit</span> method is getting called and applies the rules that determined by our project and returns the result of user credit.

#### Sending Text Message To User

The [Twilio Api](./resources/links/Twilio.url) is getting used to inform user about their credit application result. Once applied, user will recieve text message which contains information about the result of credit application along with It's amount...

Maven, pom.xml configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.twilio.sdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>twilio</artifactId>
  <version>8.25.1</version>
</dependency>
```
